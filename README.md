# GH-Codespaces-Beta
This is my first attempt at using the new GitHub Codespaces

## What will happen?
For starters, I'll edit some markup files.  After that, some Python code.

## Where is this all going?
Good question. We will have to see, won't we? :octocat:

Blah, blah, blah. There - there's a change to commit now. Happy?
